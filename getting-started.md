# Getting Started

Welcome to Billing 101. We're going to walk you through using Invoiced to get paid. Our documentation is broken up into several topics as shown in the left sidebar.

## Getting Started

In this tutorial we are going to show you how to get set up on Invoiced all the way to issuing your first invoice.

If you have not already then you need to [sign up](/signup) for an Invoiced account. We offer a 30-day free trial with no credit card or obligations required. During the onboarding process we will ask you a few questions like what payment methods you want to accept. After you have set up your business then you will be signed into the dashboard.

The dashboard is where you can access all of your customer and billing data. Since it is a web application the only system requirement is a modern web browser. As a bonus the dashboard is responsive which means it can be used on any device, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This means you can run your business from anywhere (with Internet).

### Creating your first invoice

Creating an invoice is a fairly simple process. After all, it's the main thing that Invoiced was designed to do. If you click on the **Invoices** section in the left sidebar you will be taken to the invoices page. Then click the big **New Invoice** button.

Now you are inside of the invoice editor. Let's select the customer that we are invoicing. Click the dropdown where it says *Find or create client* and start typing your customer's name. Since that customer does not exist yet you can select *Add Joe Customer as a new client*. A new dialog will appear where you can enter your customer's billing information.

How do you plan to get paid? We support two collection modes: automatic or manual. Manual collection mode will invoice your customer according to the payment terms you select. They will then pay the invoice according to the payment methods you accept. Automatic collection mode will perform a charge automatically when an invoice is issued.

For this example we're going to select *manual* and *Net 7* payment terms. This means that payment is due within 7 days. Once you have entered in your customer's information then you can click **Create**.

The customer has been selected with our payment terms filled in. The final step is to add the line items for this invoice.

### Sending the invoice

After building your line items you are ready to go. If you are not ready to go live with this invoice then you can save it as a draft. An invoice is not considered due until it has been issued. By clicking **Save and Issue** the invoice will be posted to the customer's account and is now considered due.

After issuing the invoice we will ask if you want to send it. If you choose not to send it now you will have the option to send it later or else mark the invoice as sent if you sent the invoice using some other medium. Let's go ahead and send it now.

The message will be populated with the default email template (hint: you can change the defaults in **Settings** > **Emails**). Whenever you click **Send** your customer will receive an email with your branding, your message, and a **View Invoice** button.

### Getting paid

When your customer clicks the **View Invoice** button they will be taken to the invoice in the billing portal. The billing portal is where customer's can view and pay invoices, in addition to having access to their past billing history. One nifty feature is that once your customer views the invoice we will send you a notification to let you know they have seen it.

This is what your client would see:

Here the client can leave a comment, download the invoice, and of course, pay it. In order to pay they would simply click the **Pay Invoice** button. They will be taken to the payment page to select a payment method.

Here's what would happen if your customer decided to pay with a credit or debit card.

Once your customer pays online then we will record the payment automatically in the dashboard.

#### Receiving offline payments like checks and wire transfers

If your client chooses to pay using an offline payment method, like check, then we will display your payment instructions. They can even let you know once the check is in the mail.

![Check Invoice Payment](/docs/img/check-invoice-payment.png)

Once you receive the payment you will need to record the payment through the dashboard in order to mark the invoice as paid. You can do this by going to the **Payments** section, clicking **Record Payment**, fill in the form, and click **Save**.
