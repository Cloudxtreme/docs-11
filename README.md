In the context above lets add a client name **Ben Bitdiddle**.  We first search for Ben and if he cannot be found the system gives us an option to add him.

Since Ben is not in the system we simply click on `Add Ben as a new client`.  The below modal should popup in the app.

The `Name` field you want to make sure you enter your client's full name in correctly.  

`Client Number` is a auto-incremented field and you do not need to do anything to it unless you want a custom client numbering system.

`Email` field is an important field used by the system to send the invoice; please make sure it is entered correctly as well.

`Payment Terms` are the terms that specifiy when the payment on the invoice is due.  For `NET 7` means that payment should be due within 7 days of recepit. For `NET 14` means that payment should be due within 14 days of recepit. For `NET 30` means that payment should be due within 30 days of recepit.  You can define any custom term by directly inputing it into the input box.

`Address` lets you enter the address of your client.

Invoiced validates your clients address so you can know if the address you entered is valid or not.  Usually green check mark against Address 1, City, State, Zip, County will indicate if the address is valid.  

The below is a valid address.
