#Payments Guide

Payments are at the core of Invoiced, and our system is setup to let you manually record payments to subscriptions and invoices and if you accept and enable PayPal, credit cards, or bitcoin we will automatically record that payment to your invoice. 

Online payments let your customers directly pay the invoice through our system.  Offline payments are payments from any payment source that you manually record and tie into a invoice.

###Online Payments
Online payments are essential if you want to get paid quicker.  They also are key to auto-charging your clients through subscriptions. Generally our system lets you accept credit cards, bitcoin, and PayPal.

For Credit Cards and Bitcoin we use a payment processor called Stripe.  Note: We may enable additional payment processors in the future.

After setting up Stripe and PayPal you may want to note how long it typically takes to receive payments.  You can find that information for **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/help/transfers)** and **[PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-standard)**

####Setting up Online Payments

Invoiced makes setting up Stripe and PayPal dead simple.  Here is how you can set them up.

###Setting Up Offline Payment Instructions

Invoiced lets you give instructions to your clients about the different offline payments methods you accept and how to pay them.  This is done in a nice workflow.  

When the client clicks on **View Invoice > Pay Invoice** they will be presented about the various payment options you accept and how to pay them. They can also notify you when they expect you to get the payment.

You can see this workflow in our **[Getting Started Guide](docs#getting-paid)**.

To set this up go to **Settings > Payments**

**![Enable Offline Payments](../img/invoice-online-payments.png)**

Then enable which offline payments you accept, and provide instructions for them.

###Refunding Payments

Whenever a payment is made on a invoice generated by a subscription (automatic or manual) or invoice, Invoiced records a payment.

To get a quick glance at all the invoices, subscriptions, and payments a client has, simply go into the client details by clicking on a client name, after you selected *Clients* from the left navigation bar.

Simply click on a payment you want to refund.  Once the payment details show up, click on the *Refund* button.
