## On-line Payments
Invoiced lets you accept on-line payments such as Credit Cards, Bitcoin, and PayPal.  On-line payments are essential if you want to get paid quicker.  They also are key to auto-charging your clients through subscriptions. 

For Credit Cards and Bitcoin we use a payment processor called Stripe.  *Note: We may enable additional payment processors in the future*

After setting up Stripe and PayPal you may want to note how long it typically takes to receive payments.  You can find that information for Stripe Here(TODO LINK) and PayPal(here) 

###Setting up On-line Payments
