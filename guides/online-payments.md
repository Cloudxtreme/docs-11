#Online Payments Guide

Invoiced lets you accept online payments such as Credit Cards, Bitcoin, and PayPal.  Online payments are essential if you want to get paid quicker.  They also are key to auto-charging your clients through subscriptions. 

For Credit Cards and Bitcoin we use a payment processor called Stripe.  *Note: We may enable additional payment processors in the future*

After setting up Stripe and PayPal you may want to note how long it typically takes to receive payments.  You can find that information for [Stripe](https://stripe.com/help/transfers) and [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-standard)

###Refunding Payments

Whenever a payment is made on a invoice generated by a subscription (automatic or manual), or invoice, Invoiced records a payment.

To get a quick glance at all the invoices, subscriptions, and payments a client has, simply go into the client details by clicking on a client name, after you selected `Clients` from the left navigation bar.

Simply click on a payment you want to refund.  Once the payment details show up, click on the `Refund` button.
